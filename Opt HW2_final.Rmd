## Q1
### Part A

Let $x_1$ = the number of tortes that Max eats

Let $x_2$ = the number of pies that Max eats


MAX $4x_1 + 5x_2$

ST: 

$2x_1 + 3x_2 <= 60$

$x_1, x_2 >= 0$

Solve using the graphical method:

(Red line is the objectove function.)

```{r Q1A, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

fun1 <- function(x) 60/3 -2/3*x
fun2 <- function(x) 0

x1 = seq(0,40)
m = function(x) -4/5*x +24
mydf = data.frame(x1, y1=fun1(x1), y2=fun2(x1), y3 = m(x1))
mydf <-  transform(mydf, z = pmax(y1,pmin(y2)))
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = x1)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = y1), colour = 'blue') +
  geom_line(aes(y = y2), colour = 'green') +
  geom_line(aes(y = y3), colour = 'red')+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax = z), fill = 'gray60')

```

You can see from the above graph that the optimal solution is the point [30,0], meaning that Max should eat 30 tortes and 0 pies for a total of 120 points.
This conclusion is confirmed in the code below:

```{r Q1AR}
library('lpSolve')
#objective coefficients
c<-c(4,5)

#LHS of constraints
# define a 4x2 matrixn of zeros
A<-matrix(0,3,2)

# minutes constraint
A[1,]<-c(2,3)
# Non-negativity constraint
A[2,]<-c(1,0)
#Non-negativity constraints
A[3,]<-c(0,1)

#RHS of constraints
b<-c(60,0,0)

#All constraints have a <=
#dir<-rep("<=",4)
dir<-c("<=",">=",">=")
#solve the LP and assign the returned strcture to variable s
s=lp("max",c,A,dir,b,compute.sens = 1)
```

```{r Q1AR1, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE}
#status
cat("Status:",s$status,"\n")

#solution
cat("Solution:",s$solution,"\n") 

#profit
cat("Points:",s$objval,"\n")
```

### Part B
Let $x_1$ = the number of tortes that Max eats

Let $x_2$ = the number of pies that Max eats


MAX $4x_1 + 5x_2$

ST: 

$2x_1 + 3x_2 <= 60$

$x_1 - x_2 <= 0$

$x_1, x_2 >= 0$

Solve using the graphical method:

(Red line is the objectove function.)

```{r Q1B, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
fun1 <- function(x) 60/3 -2/3*x
fun2 <- function(x) x
fun3 <- function(x) 0

x1 = seq(0,30)
m = function(x) -4/5*x +21.5
mydf = data.frame(x1, y1=fun1(x1), y2=fun2(x1), y3=fun3(x1), y4 = m(x1))
mydf <-  transform(mydf, z = pmax(y1,pmin(y2)))
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = x1)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = y1), colour = 'blue') +
  geom_line(aes(y = y2), colour = 'green') +
  geom_line(aes(y = y3), colour = 'black')+
  geom_line(aes(y = y4), colour = 'red')+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=y2,ymax = z), fill = 'gray60')


#geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=y1,ymax = z), fill = 'gray60')
```

You can see in the above graph that the new optimal solution is [12,12], meaning that Max should eat 12 tortes and 12 pies for a total of 108 points, decreasing his total points by 12 from the previous scenario. This solution is confirmed in the code below:


```{r Q1BR}
c<-c(4,5)
# define a 4x2 matrixn of zeros
A<-matrix(0,4,2)

# minutes constraint
A[1,]<-c(2,3)
# minutes constraint
A[2,]<-c(1,-1)
# Non-negativity constraint
A[3,]<-c(1,0)
#Non-negativity constraints
A[4,]<-c(0,1)

#RHS of constraints
b<-c(60,0,0,0)

#All constraints have a <=
#dir<-rep("<=",4)
dir<-c("<=","<=",">=",">=")
#solve the LP and assign the returned strcture to variable s
s=lp("max",c,A,dir,b,compute.sens = 1)
```

```{r Q2BR2, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE}
#status

cat("Points:",s$objval,"\n")

```
## Q2A
Let $x_1$ = the number of acres of wheat

Let $x_2$ = the number of acres of corn


MAX $2000x_1 + 3000x_2$

ST: 

$3x_1 + 2x_2 <= 1000$

$2x_1 + 4x_2 <= 1200$

$x_1, x_2 >= 0$

Solve using the graphical method:

(Red line is the objectove function.)
```{r Q2A, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
fun1 <- function(x) 1000/2 -3/2*x
fun2 <- function(x) 1200/4 -2/4*x
fun3 <- function(x) 0

x1 = seq(0,500)
m = function(x) -2/3*x +335
mydf = data.frame(x1, y1=fun1(x1), y2=fun2(x1), y3=fun3(x1), y4 = m(x1))
mydf <-  transform(mydf, z = pmax(0,pmin(y1,y2)))
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = x1)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = y1), colour = 'blue') +
  geom_line(aes(y = y2), colour = 'green') +
  geom_line(aes(y = y3), colour = 'black')+
  geom_line(aes(y = y4), colour = 'red')+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax = z), fill = 'gray60')

```

You can see in the above graph that the new optimal solution is [200,200], meaning that the farmer should plant 200 acres of wheat and 200 acres of corn for a total profit of $1 million. This solution is confirmed in the code below:

## Q2B

```

## Q2C
As seen from the output below, the farmer would not produce wheat when the amount of fertilizer available >=2000 tons, and would not plant corn when the amount of fertilizer <= 600 tons.

```{r Q2C}

dir<-c("<=","<=",">=",">=")
fert = c(200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000,1100,1200,1300,1400,1500,1600,1700,1800,1900,2000,2100, 2200)

for (i in fert) {

  s=lp("max",c,A,dir,b,compute.sens = 1)

Let $x_1$ = the number of servings of corn consumed

Let $x_2$ = the number of servings of milk consumed

Let $x_3$ = the number of servings of bread consumed


MIN $0.18x_1 + 0.23x_2 + 0.05x_3$

ST: 

$72x_1 + 121x_2 + 65x_3 >= 2000$

$72x_1 + 121x_2 + 65x_3 <= 2500$

$107x_1 + 500x_2 + 0x_3 >= 5000$

$107x_1 + 500x_2 + 0x_3 <= 50,000$

$x_1, x_2, x_3 >= 0$

$x_1, x_2, x_3 <= 10$


```{r Q4R}

Based on the solution above, you should consume 1.95 servings of corn, 10 servings of milk, and 10 servings of bread.

Based on the solution above, the cutting schedule is to harvest 0, 1.2, & 0.8 acres from forest 1 in years 1, 2, & 3, and to harvest 0.7, 0.3, & 2 acres, respectively, from forest 2 in years 1, 2, & 3.


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
